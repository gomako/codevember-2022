# Codevember 2022

THREE.js sketches for Codevember 2022. Structure heavily influenced by [Jaume Sanchez](https://github.com/spite/codevember-2021) and [Yuri Artiukh](https://twitter.com/akella).

I am going to be trying to build up to my own version of [generative machines](https://mflux.tumblr.com/post/29879318929/generativemachines), a Google experiment by [Michael Chang](https://twitter.com/mflux) and undoubtably it'll look 1% as good.

It's going to be quick and hacky as I don't have much time outside of life and day job. If you see anything horrible please let me know, constructive criticism always welcome.

I will be relying on modern javascript so no build tools, no npm, no package.json.

I'll be posting on [my Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/_gomako/).
